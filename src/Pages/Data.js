        about: "The jaguar (Panthera onca) is a large cat species and the only living member of the genus Panthera native to the Americas.With a body length of up to 1.85 m(6 ft 1 in) and a weight of up to 158 kg(348 lb), it is the biggest cat species in the Americas and the third largest in the world.",
        behavior: "The jaguar is a solitary animal and lives and hunts alone, except during mating season. The male's homerange is between 19 to 53 square miles. The female's homerange is between 10 to 37 square miles. A male jaguar may share his home range with several females. He will aggressively protect his homerange from other males to ensure that any females in his territory mate only with him.The Jaguar, unlike most big cats, loves the water.It often swims, bathes and plays in streams and pools.It will also hunt for fish in the water.",
        LifeCycle: "Jaguars mate year- round.About 100 days after mating the female has one to four kittens.She will give birth in a cave den or a thicket.The kittens are born with their eyes closed.At birth they have fuzzy spotted fur.The kittens begin to hunt when they are six months old.They will stay with their mother for about two years.The jaguar has a lifespan of 15 - 20 years.",
        Diet: "The jaguar is a carnivore.It hunts mostly at night.Its prey includes capybara, peccaries, deer, large ground birds, fish, snakes, turtles and rabbits.It will also eat livestock like horses, cows and sheep.The jaguar hunts mostly on the ground, but it sometimes climbs a tree and pounces on its prey from above.The jaguar has very powerful jaws and sharp teeth and usually kills its prey with one crushing bite to the skull.",
        Habitat: "The jaguar makes its home in a wide variety of habitats including deciduous forests, rainforests, swamps, pampas grasslands and mountain scrub areas.",

        about: "The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest living cat species and a member of the genus Panthera. It is most recognisable for its dark vertical stripes on orange fur with a white underside. An apex predator, it primarily preys on ungulates, such as deer and wild boar. It is territorial and generally a solitary but social predator, requiring large contiguous areas of habitat to support its requirements for prey and rearing of its offspring. Tiger cubs stay with their mother for about two years and then become independent, leaving their mother's home range to establish their own.",

        about: "The lion’s name derives from the Latin Leo; the ancient Greek λέων (leon) with the Hebrew word lavi possibly also related. The generic component of its scientific designation, Panthera¸ is presumed to derive from Greek pan– (“all”) and ther (“beast”) but this may be folk etymology. The name came into English through the classical languages, but panther, is probably of East Asian origin meaning “the yellowish animal”.The lion was first classified as Felis Leo by Linnaeus in 1758 from a specimen found in Constantine, Algeria",
